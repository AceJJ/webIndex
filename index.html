	Do you love delicious, out of this world burgers? Of course you do. It's easy to see why all extraterrestrial life
	&nbsp;loves them too.<br><br>
	In the near future, Earth promotes intergalactic peace by running an exceptional take out
	&nbsp;food delivery service. Using delivery drones capable of moving at 5 times the speed of light,
	&nbsp;we are able to guarantee fresh, never frozen burgers, with premium toppings, delivered to any planet in 15 seconds or less.<br><br>
	The best drone operators avoid crashing their drones, while consistently beating Earth's 15 second guarantee.<br><br>
	Coming soon to iOS.</div>
